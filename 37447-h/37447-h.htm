<h2>INTRODUCTION.</h2>

<p class="chapcap">It is surprising that so few efforts have hitherto been made in this country to
introduce manual training into Elementary Schools. Adequate reason for
making such training part of the national system of education exists in the fact,
that a large proportion of the people have to earn their livelihood by industries
for the attainment of a high degree of skill in which early training of hand and
eye is as necessary as it is for success in the use of musical instruments. There
can be no doubt that if, in 1870, a system, resembling that of Sloyd, had been
generally introduced into English Elementary Schools, the joiners, metal-workers,
and most other craftsmen of to-day, would possess more skill in their own work,
and more interest in all kinds of manual work, than they do now possess, and
that English workpeople, finding that their children received at school kinds of
training obviously well fitted to increase wage-earning power, would less commonly
than now be careless with regard to their children&#8217;s attendance at school.</p>

<p>This reason for desiring the introduction of manual training into Elementary
Schools might have been expected to suggest itself to all persons who are acquainted
with the conditions under which the mass of English people live; but
experience gained in Sweden and other countries where the Sloyd system has
been largely used, proves that there are also strong educational reasons for desiring
that Sloyd shall be introduced into all English Elementary Schools as soon as
possible. It has been found that this admirably graduated system of training not
only fosters deftness of hand and correctness of eye, as it might be expected to
do, but also has distinctly moral and intellectual effects, as it promotes patient
attention, steady application, and interest in work, to a very high degree.</p>

<p>Its effect on many of the large class of children who, though not dullards,
show lack of interest in, and deficiency in the power to understand, the subjects
comprised in the ordinary school-curriculum, has been most beneficial. In their
Sloyd-lessons many of these children have found themselves the equals, some
more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
than the equals, of companions far their superiors at book-work, and have by this
gained a confidence in their own ability which has often reacted on their power
and their will to conquer their other lessons. Thus many children who, when
they first began Sloyd, were distinctly below the average in intelligence, have
become under its influence completely &#8220;normal.&#8221; On nearly all children the effect
of this kind of training has been so vivifying that, at least, as much progress has
been made with other subjects, when several hours weekly have been given to Sloyd,
as had been made previously when all the school-time was given to them. The
general educational value of Sloyd has, indeed, been found to be so great, that in
some schools in Swedish towns as many as eight hours are given to it each week.</p>

<p>All persons who know how badly prepared are the majority of the children
who now leave our Elementary Schools for gaining rapidly skill in the work by
which they have to live, or for taking an intelligent interest in their own work or
in the best handiwork of others, most strongly desire that the educational authorities
in this country will no longer delay the introduction of a system, the great usefulness
of which has been so fully ascertained in other lands, and for which many
well-trained English teachers can now be obtained. Mr Sutcliffe brought to the
careful study of Sloyd, knowledge of the methods of wood-carving; and his treatise
will doubtless be found to be helpful to all teachers of the new system.</p>

<h3>NOTE BY THE AUTHOR.</h3>

<p>Some friends have advised that elementary suggestions should have been given
as guidance for the use of the tools. Everything of the kind has been omitted,
because it is vain to rely upon book knowledge in such matters. How to handle
and use the tools can only be well imparted by a competent teacher in practice.
The author avails himself of two more lines, wherein to acknowledge the valuable
literary assistance he has received from his friend, Mr Richard Russell, of
Ashbourne House, Herne Hill, London.</p>

<h2>HAND-CRAFT.</h2>


<p class="chapcap">For some generations there has been cultivated in Sweden,
and amongst Scandinavian and kindred peoples, a course of
training in personal ingenuity, unknown in most other countries.
It does not seem to have ever been persevered in after the
manner of trading industry, but as a means of promoting throughout
the community a taste and skill for the performance of highly-finished
productions in mechanical art, proceeding from the simple
to the complex, and resulting in a widely-diffused facility for all
kinds of constructive occupations.</p>

<p>Such course or system of training is called Sloyd, and written
Sl&ouml;jd. For the majority of English people such a word cannot
have a meaning, and cannot appeal with adequate force to popular
appreciation. The nearest equivalent in English to the Swedish
word Sl&ouml;jd would seem to be Hand-Craft, or mechanical training
for the hand, undertaken voluntarily for the satisfaction of acquiring
manual skill in general, as distinguished from a handicraft of
limited application, pursued of necessity from day to day, rather
by routine than by skill.</p>

<p>Hand-Craft is therefore adopted as synonymous in England
with the word Sl&ouml;jd in Sweden.</p>

<p>As cultivated in Sweden, it involves all kinds of manual<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
training, and is applicable to highly finished productions in leather,
metal, and various other substances, but it suffices, for educational
purposes, to limit teaching and exercise to objects made of wood.</p>

<p>It must always be borne in mind that Hand-Craft is mainly
educational, and is valuable, not for what it produces, but for the
training which the production involves; just as the letters of the
alphabet, and their accurate use, are the essential preliminaries
to literary attainments. It imparts and cultivates mechanical
dexterity, just as learning to read and write spontaneously
developes mental capacity. Therefore, whoever masters a course
of Hand-Craft acquires an aptitude for all kinds of material processes.
Such an aptitude, while useful and gratifying to the
individual, is of the greatest consequence amongst people so
deeply interested as the English are in manufacturing pursuits.</p>

<p>Hand-Craft also has strong claims to be cultivated as a
recreation, and experience proves that it may be so regarded, with
every prospect of becoming popular as such.</p>

<p>Touching this matter of recreation, and those who have not
the faculty for viewing the subject in that light, reference may be
made to familiar facts with reference to chess. Perhaps there is
nothing that, to the uninitiated, appears more stupid, insipid, and
purposeless than the progress of that game. Yet there are
thousands, who have so regarded it, who, after being well initiated,
have become interested and absorbed by it, to an extent exceeding
the possibilities of their original belief.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>So it is with Hand-Craft, with this difference, that Hand-Craft,
while supplying an incentive to wholesome perseverance, developing
into a fascinating recreation, is suggestive at every turn of
life-long utility, with reference to an infinite variety of probable
subsequent experience. It promotes a delightful consciousness of
the merits of neat, natty tastefulness and judgment with reference
to every material thing, and trains the mind and the eye, as well as
the hand, to perceive and appreciate excellence of design and
finish, proportion, beauty, and adaptability of the most familiar
appliances.</p>

<p>Training of this kind has, in recent years, been much stimulated
by the establishment of an Institute or Seminary for its
teaching and cultivation at N&auml;&auml;s in Sweden, where very generous
accommodation and facilities are provided for the instruction
of teachers from all parts of Sweden and the rest of the world.
The subsequent mission of each of those teachers is to diffuse the
taste and knowledge he has thus acquired amongst his own people
on his return to them, or amongst other people where he may find
encouragement to settle for that purpose.</p>

<p>Thus have the foundations been laid for this genial drawing
out and exercise of latent mechanical genius amongst the people of
England. With the object of widening those foundations, these
pages have been prepared; primarily as forming a Text Book for
Teachers, but also as an incentive to parents, educationists, and
statesmen to fortify the rising generation of England against the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
opprobrium so justly alleged against the English of the present day,
that they are behind the rest of the industrial world in those
elements of mechanical taste and skill, which are becoming more
and more essential to the maintenance of manufacturing and
commercial prosperity.</p>

<p>An earnest determination to promote amendment in these
respects cannot be better carried into effect than by insisting that
Hand-Craft shall be regarded as an essential branch of the Technical
Education that is now struggling to assert itself usefully. If
such a branch be left out, the mere teaching of routine trade
processes will inevitably fail. Such routine processes are many of
them in heavy-handed, rough disregard of the nicety, accuracy,
finish, and judgment which intelligent exercise in Hand-Craft can
alone impart; which is the only reliable basis for the superior
mechanical results so much needed.</p>

<p>Hand-Craft in wood is distinguished from carpentry or joinery
in many important respects.</p>

<p>There is no division of labour.</p>

<p>Everything produced is the entire work of one operator, for
the defects of which he is solely responsible.</p>

<p>This directness of responsibility is one of the great merits of
Hand-Craft, being calculated to promote wholesome pride in the
excellence of complete work; a sentiment that is apt to be very weak,
or totally wanting, where division of labour is much relied upon.</p>

<p>The intellectual faculties are brought into unison with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
hand, by knowledge and experience developing together with
increasing dexterity.</p>

<p>Genuine respect and sympathy are developed for manual toil
by familiarity with its application.</p>

<p>Love of work in general is developed, and a taste for it instilled
by practical experience of its utility.</p>

<p>Habits of attention, perseverance, industry, and discipline are
formed, cultivated, and unconsciously grafted upon the pupil, by
the application necessary to excel.</p>

<p>Independence, order, and cleanliness spontaneously grow and
become part of the nature of the operator.</p>

<p>Manual dexterity being thoroughly established, the operator
is endowed with the consequent acquired ability for dealing with
the practical business of life.</p>

<p>Education being the object that should be constantly kept in
view, in the teaching and practice of Hand-Craft, it should be
thoroughly appreciated that it is adapted for forming and shaping
the entire bent of all the faculties.</p>

<p>The objects recommended to work upon are all small, and are
therefore within the capacity of the very young, and of both sexes.</p>

<p>For the same reason, the eye, the hand, and the judgment are
trained to precise form and finish in the minutest details. This is
important, for, though it is generally easier to make something large
and rough than small and smooth, no one who is incapable of
making a small model well can make a large one any better.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
Small objects are invariably the best training to work upon, as
being certain to inspire appreciation for neatness, exactness, and
accuracy.</p>


<h3>BASIS OF TEACHING.</h3>

<p>Practical teaching of Hand-Craft is based upon models for
imitation.</p>

<p>These models, distinguished by numbering from 1A and 1B
to 25, are represented by the drawings accompanying these
pages, and the instructions hereafter subjoined are explained by
reference to the drawings.</p>

<p>The following is a</p>


<h3>LIST OF THE MODELS.</h3>

<p><span class="exponlarge">*</span><span class="indexlarge">*</span><span class="exponlarge">*</span> The
second column indicates the kind of wood required&mdash;B. signifying Beech or Birch, and F. signifying Fir, commonly
called Deal or Pine; the class of wood usually distinguished as
Pine being preferable to the rougher-grained wood generally
classed as Deal.</p>

<p>Although the prices of the English tools are so much higher
than the Swedish (with few exceptions), they are cheaper in the
end. They are more carefully made; the wood is drier and better
selected; and Swedish steel is not to be compared with English.
At the same time, the Swedish tools are good enough to put
into the hands of school boys and girls, and they have also
the advantage of being considerably lighter in weight.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>


<h3>THE BENCH.</h3>

<p>A <a href="#Fig0">drawing</a> of the Bench is annexed, to show the difference
between one adapted for Sloyd or Hand-Craft and the kind in
common use by carpenters. The Sloyd Bench is usually
about 7 ft. long, 2 ft. wide, and 3 ft. 3 in. high. As shown
in the drawing, it has an extra Bench Screw at the end, which
enables the student to fix a piece of level wood rigidly on the top
of the Bench, by placing the end against a Stop, as shown in the
drawing, and bringing the pressure of the End Screw to bear on
the other end. The numerous holes (shown in the drawing) on
the Bench Top, are so arranged that the Stop can be fixed in any
of them. For school work the Benches are often made double&mdash;that
is, with a Screw on each side and on each end of the Bench.
This arrangement economises space, and answers all practical
purposes; enabling two students to work at one bench. The
Sloyder will find it an advantage to fix a small drawer under the
bench top. In this he should keep his sand-paper and files, as
nothing is so detrimental to the edges of the sharp tools as these
two articles.</p>

<p>The following are the descriptions of how to apply the Exercises
to the making of the Models.</p>


<h3><span class="smcap"><a name="Mod1A" id="Mod1A"></a>No. 1a. Kindergarten Pointer.</span></h3>

<p class="center">(Requiring <a href="#ExList">Exercises</a> 1 and 2.)</p>

<p>Commence with a piece of Beech, rather more than 5 in. long,
and not less than <span class="expon">3</span>&#8260;<span class="index">4</span> in. thick. It is all the better, for this and other
exercises, if it is split from a larger piece, and has no side either
square or straight. With the knife, make one side level and
smooth, to a width rather exceeding <span class="expon">3</span>&#8260;<span class="index">8</span> in. When that is done
perfectly, make another straight side at right angles to the first.
Trim the ends; then mark with the pencil at each end a <span class="expon">3</span>&#8260;<span
class="index">8</span>-in.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
square, with the two straight sides as bases. Then cut two
additional straight sides in unison with those squares. This will
produce a stem a shade more than 5 in. long and <span class="expon">3</span>&#8260;<span class="index">8</span> in. square.
Mark each end with a diagram thus <img src="images/illo21.png" alt="Mark" width="20" height="20" />&nbsp;; then draw corresponding
lines along each side. Then, letting one end remain the same size;
reduce the other end to <span class="expon">1</span>&#8260;<span class="index">8</span> in. square (as shown in centre of diagram)
by tapering each side symmetrically throughout. This will result
in the stem being <span class="expon">3</span>&#8260;<span class="index">8</span> in.
square at one end and <span class="expon">1</span>&#8260;<span class="index">8</span> in. square at the
other end. Then, guided by the diagram at the thicker end, take
off the four corners symmetrically throughout, thus producing a
tapered octagonal stem. Then, in like manner, take off the eight
corners with great precision, so as to maintain uniform symmetry,
and the result will be a tapered stem, approximately round throughout
and pointed at one end.</p>

<p>The Long Cut having, thus far, been solely resorted to,
measure from the point, and make a mark at 4 in.; then cut off at
the mark, thus exercising the Cross Cut. Then, by judiciously
applying sand-paper, the pointer may be made perfectly smooth
and almost perfectly round, as it should be throughout.</p>

<p>Proceed as for the <a href="#Mod1A">previous model</a> until the round pointer is
produced. Then apply <a href="#ExList">Exercise 3</a> to the two Oblique Cuts
shown<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
from <i>A</i> to <i>a</i> in the figures 1, 2, and 3, of <a href="#Fig1B">drawings No. 1<span class="smcap">b</span></a>. These
Oblique Cuts demand great care and precision, as the Cuts should
be precisely opposite each other, perfectly level and symmetrical.</p>

<p class="center">(Requiring <a href="#ExList">Exercises</a> 1, 2, and 4.)</p>

<p>Commence with a piece of Beech rather more than 3 in. long
and <span class="expon">5</span>&#8260;<span class="index">8</span> in. thick. Reduce it in like manner
as <a href="#Mod1A">previously described</a>
to a stem 3 in. long and <span class="expon">3</span>&#8260;<span class="index">8</span> in. square throughout. Then apply
Exercise 4, and so bevel the sides and ends as to make chamfers,
as shown in Figs. 1, 2, and 3 of <a href="#Fig2">drawings No. 2</a>. Then draw a
line across the centre of one side, and there cut a <span class="lettsymb">V</span>-shaped notch
as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, so as to provide for a string. Then
finish with a piece of sand-paper laid upon a flat surface, upon
which first rub the sides, then the chamfers, and lastly the ends.</p>

<p>This is the first model made in soft wood, and introduces
<a href="#ExList">Exercise 5</a>, Sawing Off. From the edge of a
<span class="expon">3</span>&#8260;<span class="index">4</span>-in. board saw off a
piece the same width as the thickness, and about 14 in. long.
Proceed as for No. 1<span class="smcap">a</span> until a rod is produced
<span class="expon">1</span>&#8260;<span class="index">2</span> in. square throughout.
Then, by a cross made from corner to corner <img src="images/illo22.png" alt="Cross" width="19" height="20" /> find
the centre of one end. Then take off the corners throughout
until an octagonal rod is produced; then take off the eight
corners so as to make the rod round and the same thickness
throughout. Then apply <a href="#ExList">Exercise 6</a>, the Convex Cut, and point
the end where the centre is marked. Then measure from the
point and mark at 12 in., and there cut off at right angles.
Then apply sand-paper, and the result will be a tapered symmetrical
round rod, pointed at one end, as shown in <a href="#Fig3">drawings No. 3</a>.</p>

<p>Saw from Beech, a piece about 8 in. long, <span class="expon">3</span>&#8260;<span
class="index">4</span> in. wide and <span class="expon">1</span>&#8260;<span class="index">2</span> in.
thick. With the knife, make one of the flat sides perfectly level
and smooth throughout, and cut one end across at right angles.
With a fine pencil, draw on the level side the outline of Fig 1 of
<a href="#Fig4">drawings No. 4</a>, and also, with compasses, describe on the end the
semicircle shown by Fig 3 of <a href="#Fig4">drawings No. 4</a>, with the flat edge
for the base. Apply the long cut to the edges at right angles to
the flat side. Then, on each of the edges thus flattened, draw a
line showing the course of the tapering illustration on the first side
of Fig. 2 of <a href="#Fig4">drawings No. 4</a>. Apply the long cut to each of those
lines, at right angles to the edges. This will produce a rod, flat
on one side, and presenting a tapered half square on the other.
Then shave off the corners of that square, so as to produce half a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
tapered octagon; then shave off the corners of that octagon, being
careful that the work is in unison with the semicircle previously
described on the thick end. When so far done to satisfaction,
round both ends symmetrically, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2 of
<a href="#Fig4">drawings No. 4</a>, and finish with sand-paper.</p>

<p>In this model the Jack Plane and the Try Square are used for
the first time. Saw off from Pine a piece about 16 in. long and <span class="expon">3</span>&#8260;<span class="index">4</span>
in. square. Plane one side straight and true, and one of the other
sides at right angles. Cut each end across at right angles, and on
each end, using the planed edges as basis, mark Fig. 2 of <a href="#Fig5">drawings
No. 5</a>. Then plane the other two sides at right angles, so as to
produce a square rod, which, at every part throughout its length,
should fit the try square. Then, with the plane, take about two
shavings off each corner, in unison with the figures at the ends.
Then, with the knife, cut the point from <i>a</i> to <i>a</i> as shown in Fig. 1
of <a href="#Fig5">drawings No. 5</a>. Then measure from the long-pointed end,
mark the exact length, cut across at the mark, and cut the other
end to a point with eight sides as shown in Figs. 1 and 2.
Finish with sand-paper at the long-pointed end only.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a></span></p>

<p>This model for the first time introduces the Brace and Bit.
Saw off from Pine a piece 10 in. long, and <span class="expon">3</span>&#8260;<span class="index">4</span> in. square. With the
knife, cut one end across at right angles, and make it smooth.
Find the centre of the end as for <a href="#Mod1A">model No. 1</a>. Fix the stem
vertically in the Bench Screw, with the smooth end upwards. Fit
a <span class="expon">3</span>&#8260;<span class="index">16</span>-Shell-Bit into the Brace, and bore a centre hole in the end of
the stem as shown in Fig. 2 of <a href="#Fig6">drawings No. 6</a>, and to the depth
dotted in Fig. 1. Great care must be taken in drilling, so that
the hole may be clean and perpendicular. With the knife, pare
down each side so as to leave a <span class="expon">1</span>&#8260;<span class="index">2</span>-in. square, with the drilled hole
in the centre. Find the centre in the opposite end. Mark a line
about 2<span class="expon">1</span>&#8260;<span class="index">4</span> in. from the drilled end, as shown in Fig. 1. From that
line, shave each side down to the centre last found. Then take
off the corners so as to make a tapered octagon. Then take off
the corners of the octagon, so as to produce a round tapered rod.
Measure from the thick end and mark the exact length, and, at the
mark, cut across. Then round the end as shown in Fig. 1, and
finish with sand-paper.</p>

<p>This is mainly intended for an exercise in planing, and it is
better to get out a piece of Pine sufficient for two models&mdash;that is,
about 9 in. long, 1<span class="expon">3</span>&#8260;<span class="index">4</span> in. wide, and 1 in. thick.</p>

<p>Plane one side, and then one edge, perfectly straight and
square to each other. Then set the gauge to 1<span class="expon">1</span>&#8260;<span class="index">2</span> in. to fit Fig. 1 of
<a href="#Fig7">drawings No. 7</a>. Apply the gauge to the straightened edge and
mark off the width along the smooth side. Then plane that edge
down to the line so made, using the try-square to keep the edge at
right angles with the straightened side. Next find the centre <span class="expon">3</span>&#8260;<span class="index">4</span> in.
from the top end, as shown in Fig. 1. From that centre describe
with the compasses a semicircle. Then fit a <span class="expon">3</span>&#8260;<span class="index">16</span>-Shell-bit into the
Brace, and bore a hole, at the centre of the semicircle, right
through. Then set the gauge to <span class="expon">5</span>&#8260;<span class="index">16</span> in. for the thickness, as shown
by Fig. 2. Apply the gauge to the straightened side, and mark
the line for thickness along each edge. Then plane the rough side
down to those lines. Then, with the knife, cut round precisely to
the semicircle, using the try-square frequently.</p>

Brace, and bore two holes, one at <i>A</i> and the other at <i>B</i>. Then,
with the smaller turning saw, cut the two outside curved edges as
shown in Fig. 1. With the knife, trim to the lines, making the
edges square, as shown in Fig. 3. Then shave and slightly round
each semicircle, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, smoothing the edges
with the file. Then set the Marking Gauge to <span class="expon">1</span>&#8260;<span class="index">4</span> in., and, with the
smooth side for a base, mark gauge lines on each edge for thickness,
and plane the rough side down to those lines. Then set the

one side straight and another side at right angles. Set the Marking
Gauge to 1 in., and with the planed side as base, mark lines
for thickness along each planed side. Then plane the rough sides
down to those lines, using the Try Square frequently. Then, at
each end find the centre thus <img src="images/illo32a.png" alt="Marker"

lines from end to end of each side corresponding with
the corners of each octagon. Plane the corners of the square
down to those octagon lines, thus producing an octagonal rod, and
completing the first exercise in bevel planing. Plane off the
corners of the octagon throughout, thus producing a rod approximately
round, shown in Fig. 2 of <a href="#Fig9">drawings No. 9</a>, and so completing
the first exercise in shaping with plane. Measure from one
end for the point as shown in Fig. 1, and, with the knife, cut the
point as roundly and symmetrically as possible, referring to the
centre marked at the end as a guide for the precise place of the
point. Then measure from the point and mark at 12 in. Cut
across at that mark, and round the blunt end thus made, as shown
at top of Fig. 1. With the file, dress the end and stray angles
throughout, and finish with sand-paper.</p>

compasses, describe the quarter circle shown at each top corner
of the figures, striking the segments from the respective dots shown
for the purpose near each top corner. Then, with the bottom edge<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
for a base, draw a gauge line on each side of both pieces to the
depth represented by <i>i j</i>, and with the tenon saw, make a slit at <i>e</i>
and <i>f</i> to the depth of such gauge line. Then, with the knife or
chisel, cut out the openings between <i>e</i> and <i>f</i> to the depth of the
gauge line, taking care to finish the opening perfectly level and
true. Then, at the bottom of one piece and the top of the other,
as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, gauge, saw, and cut out the spaces from
<i>g</i> to <i>h</i> in the same manner as for the spaces before mentioned.
The openings from <i>g</i> to <i>h</i>, if well done, will fit accurately in all
directions, and, when put together, will form a firm cross. Then,

along the centre of that edge, draw a line from <i>c</i> to <i>c</i>, as shown in
Fig. 1 of <a href="#Fig13">drawings No. 13</a>, and continue the line to the extremities
of both ends. Then, in manner described for No. 10, gauge, slit,
and cut out with chisel the spaces shown in the same Fig. 1 of
<a href="#Fig13">drawings No. 13</a>, from <i>a</i> to <i>a</i> and <i>b</i> to <i>b</i>. Then, with compasses,
as indicated in the same Fig., describe on both sides of each top
corner, the segment of a circle represented in each case from <i>c</i> to <i>d</i>.
Then, for the first time, resort to Concave Chiselling, and with a
broad chisel cut away the corners down to the segments previously
described. This process requires great care and judgment. Fix
one end of the work upwards in the bench screw, with the top side
nearest to the operator, and, after taking off the corner to a considerable
extent, with the bevelled side of the chisel towards the
wood, shave small pieces away until the segment marks are
reached, taking care to keep the whole curve at right angles to the
sides throughout. Then, turn the work, and dress the corner at
the other end in like manner. Then file judiciously where required,
and finish with sand-paper.</p>

draw the whole of Fig. 1 of <a href="#Fig12">drawings No. 12</a>, letting the straight
edge serve as the line from <i>A</i> to <i>B</i>. With the smaller turning
saw cut round all the curved parts, carefully adhering to the drawn
figure. Then gauge all round for thickness, as shown in Fig. 2,
plane the rough side down to the gauge lines, and with the knife
trim the curved edges where required. With the set gauge,
mark the centre of the straight edge from <i>A</i> to <i>B</i>, and guided by
that centre, pare down each corner of the straight edge, so as to make
a straight chamfer on each side about <span class="expon">1</span>&#8260;<span class="index">8</span> in. wide, terminating with
a sharp edge at the place where the gauge line was drawn, as

pare each side symmetrically, so as to produce a blade gradually
diminishing throughout from a back <span class="expon">3</span>&#8260;<span class="index">16</span> in. thick to a sharp edge.
Then pare down the end of the back to a lancet-shaped point, as

so as to make them symmetrical throughout, and also pare the
corners of the back of the blade so as to round it on both sides
very slightly. File judiciously with a light hand where required,
and then, for the first time using the scraper, complete the blade
with great care by scraping, finishing as usual with sand-paper.</p>

<p>This model is shown in the perspective Fig. 1 of <a href="#Fig14">drawings
No. 14</a>. Commence for it by cutting from Beech a piece about 5
in. long, 3 in. wide, and 1<span class="expon">1</span>&#8260;<span class="index">4</span> in. thick. Plane one side and one
edge at right angles. Then gauge for a thickness of 1 in. and
plane the rough side to the gauge lines. Determine by choice
which side shall be the bottom of the bowl and which the top.
Find the centre of the bottom side by drawing the lines from <i>A</i>
to <i>B</i> and from <i>C</i> to <i>D</i> as shown in Fig. 2. Repeat these lines on
the edges and top side, using the try square. Then, on the bottom
side, with compasses and square, draw the whole of the figures
constituting the entire diagram shown by Fig. 2, and on the top
side draw freehand the larger oval or ellipse diagram shown by
Fig. 3, being guided by the points of the guide-lines first drawn
for the purpose.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a name="Fig14" id="Fig14"></a>
<img src="images/illo43b.png" alt="Bowl" width="323" height="550" /></div>

<p>Then, with the turning saw, cut round by the line of the
ellipse on the top side, and finish the edge square with chisel and
file. Then, with finger and pencil, mark a line about <span class="expon">1</span>&#8260;<span class="index">8</span> in. inside
the outer edge all round the larger ellipse. With a <span class="expon">7</span>&#8260;<span class="index">8</span>-in. gouge
cut out the centre so as to form the inside of the bowl, the
depth and shape being shown by the dotted lines of Fig 4.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
Having so symmetrically shaped the inside and made it as smooth
as the gouge is capable of, with the round end of the scraper
dress as smoothly as possible, and finish with sand-paper, before
proceeding with the bottom side.</p>

<p>To complete the bottom side, leave the ellipse in the centre
untouched, and from its outline to the outer edge of the lip of the
bowl, shave with the knife so as to produce in all directions a
curve corresponding to those at each end of Fig. 4. Take a
shaving off the flat bottom with the smoothing plane, so as to
remove the compass marks. Then file judiciously and lightly
where required, scrape perfectly smooth, and finish with sand-paper.</p>

whole of Fig. 1 of <a href="#Fig15">drawings No. 15</a>. Then, with the
turning saw,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
cut at right angles to the curved lines on both edges throughout,
and finish the shaping with the spokeshave, taking care to maintain
right angles. Then, on one of the edges, with pencil, sketch
throughout the whole of Fig. 2, and, with saw and spokeshave,
shape both sides in unison with that sketch, still carefully
maintaining right angles throughout. Then, with the knife, shave
off the corners so as to make four symmetrical chamfers throughout.
Then, with the spokeshave, remove the corners of the
chamfers, and proceed with the paring down until the required
symmetrical elliptical shape is arrived at, as shown by Figs. 1, 2,

uniform size throughout. Saw across one end at right angles.
Measure from that cut end, mark the length of 18 in., and saw across

proceed to the first exercise in Obstacle Planing (No. 25.) Thus,
pass the smooth plane along each edge from <i>b</i> to <i>a</i>, as far as the

in. long, 1 in. wide, and <span class="expon">7</span>&#8260;<span class="index">8</span> in. thick.</p>

<p>Commencing with the larger piece, plane one side and one
edge at right angles. Then gauge-mark to a width of 3 in., and
plane the rough edge down to that mark. At the centre of the
width draw a line from end, as shown in Fig. 1, <i>f</i> to <i>f</i>. On that
line, with compasses, mark the points indicated by <i>a</i>, <i>b</i>, <i>c</i>, of Fig.
1 of the <a href="#Fig21">drawings No. 21</a>. At each point drill a
<span class="expon">5</span>&#8260;<span class="index">8</span> in. hole
right through, taking great care to drill vertically. With the
square, draw the cross lines at <i>d d</i>, the intersections with the
central line forming additional central points. Set compasses
to a radius of <span class="expon">7</span>&#8260;<span class="index">8</span> in., and, from each of those central points,
describe a semicircle as shown in the Fig.; then from each
of the same central points describe an outer semicircle as also
shown in the Fig. With tenon saw make a nick at each of the
four points <i>g</i>, in each case reaching to the outer of the semicircles,
each nick being strictly at right angles. Then, with turning saw,
follow the line of each of the outer semicircles. Then dress the edges
all round with chisel and file as required. Then gauge-mark all
round for a thickness of <span class="expon">3</span>&#8260;<span class="index">4</span>
in., and plane the rough side down to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
mark, evenly throughout. Gauge-mark all round for the chamfer,
in the proportion shown in Fig. 1, and chamfer to the mark accordingly,
using the plane for the sides and the knife for the curves and
corners. File throughout where necessary, and finish with sand-paper.</p>

<p>The smaller piece of Deal being to make the pegs with, plane
it on one side and one edge at right angles, then gauge-mark for
a width of <span class="expon">3</span>&#8260;<span class="index">4</span>
in. and for a thickness of <span class="expon">5</span>&#8260;<span class="index">8</span> in., as illustrated in section
by Fig. 4. Saw across into three lengths of 5 in. each. Place
them together on their sides, and sketch one side of each as shown
from <i>j</i> to <i>k</i> and <i>l</i> in Fig. 3, leaving the space from <i>j</i> to <i>m</i>
untouched. With the try square repeat the lines of this sketch on
both sides of each. With saw and knife cut each peg to the
sketch, finishing the whole, excepting the circular plug. Then at
the inner end, find the centre as denoted in Fig. 4, and, using the
same centre-bit as for Fig. 1, describe a circle mark as dotted in Fig.
4. Then, with the tenon saw, cut by the &#8220;shoulder&#8221; to a depth
of <span class="expon">1</span>&#8260;<span class="index">8</span> in., and pare the circle with the knife to the shoulder <i>j</i>, so
making a round plug, a little too large to go into the holes of Fig. 1.
Then, with the file, carefully reduce the size of each plug so as to
very accurately and tightly fit one hole at a time in Fig 1, where
wedging must not be tolerated. The perfection of this part of the
work is to be tested by ascertaining that the pegs are precisely in
a line, and that each one fits all round to the face of the board into
which it is inserted.</p>

<p class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>Having thus fitted each plug to its own hole, and marked it
for identification, the pegs may be completed. Cut down each
one, with the tenon saw, from <i>k</i> to <i>x</i>, and, with the chisel, pare
down from <i>j</i> to <i>k</i>, first making it square and afterwards slightly
rounding it, as shown in section of Fig. 4. With a sharp chisel
cut round to the outside of the semicircle for the top of the peg.
File this round and then cut the chamfer with the knife. File as
required, and finish with sand-paper.</p>

<p>The pegs being thus made ready for fixing, clean the face of
the board (Fig. 1) with the smooth plane, and the edges and
chamfers with sand-paper. Then glue in each plug, using the try
square to make sure that they project at right angles. Then put
the whole away for not less than six hours, to allow the glue to
set well. Then, as each plug has been purposely made slightly
too long, saw off each projection at the back, and smooth the
whole of the back with the plane, so effecting the finishing
touches.</p>

<p>To avoid the necessity for nailing to the wall, get two pieces
of hoop-iron about 1<span class="expon">1</span>&#8260;<span class="index">2</span>
in. long and <span class="expon">1</span>&#8260;<span class="index">2</span> in. wide. To adapt each
piece for its purpose, cut one end round and punch in a nail hole
and two smaller screw holes, as shown in Fig. 1. With a chisel
cut a neat recess for each iron so that it can be sunk flush with the
back, as shown in Fig. 2, and, inserting the screws, the work will
be complete.</p>

Fig. 4, and saw off a shade inside the gauge-lines. In like manner
cut five laths, and plane each to the gauge line.</p>

<p>The laths being thus made, sufficient wood will be left for the
supports. Make the width of the supports the same as that of the
laths. After gauging and planing the supports to depth as Fig. 4,

side by side, and nail them together with two 1<span class="expon">1</span>&#8260;<span class="index">2</span>-in. wrought nails,
so that both pieces can be operated upon together. Then draw on
one outer side the diagram shown on the unshaded part of Fig. 1
of <a href="#Fig23">drawings No. 23</a>, and, with the aid of try-square and compasses,
repeat the diagram on the other outer side. Then cut off each

plane, finish at perfect right angles. Then, with a <span class="expon">5</span>&#8260;<span class="index">8</span>-in. centre-bit,
drill at the spots marked <i>a a</i> on each diagram, penetrating on
one side a little more than an inch, and finishing by drilling from
the other side in precise unison. The drilling throughout must be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>

with the turning saw cutting out the three semicircles, which
finish with gouge and file, taking care to maintain right angles at
every point. Then separate the pieces, smooth each face with the
smoothing plane, and the circular parts with file and sand-paper.</p>

<p>The respective parts being now complete, mark on each lath
the distance the supports are from the ends shown in Fig. 2.
Then nail on the laths, <i>b b</i> first, <i>c</i> next, and the others afterwards.

plane the rough side and edge down to the gauge-marks. Square
one end, measuring from that end, saw off at 9 in. On the larger piece
remaining, draw the lines <i>a b</i> and <i>a b</i> in the positions shown in Fig.
2; then, with the compasses, set off the spaces from <i>a</i> to <i>c</i> and
from <i>a</i> to <i>c</i>, <i>b</i> to <i>c</i> and <i>b</i> to
<i>c</i>, <i>a</i> to <i>d</i> and <i>a</i> to <i>d</i>, <i>b</i> to <i>d</i> and <i>b</i> to <i>d</i>.
Then set the gauge to half the thickness, and with it mark the

the bevel to the oblique line at each side of the dovetails, and
transfer this bevelled line to each side at points <i>c c c c</i> and <i>d d d d</i>.
Then, with tenon saw, cut down each line <i>c d</i> to the depth of the
gauge line, and, with a small chisel, remove the whole of the pieces
between the nicks made by the saw. This will result in two grooves
for dovetailed tongues, as shown above, <i>a a</i> in Fig. 1, designed to
strengthen and prevent from warping the upper half of the holder.</p>

ends of the tongues and plane them and the face of the board
to a level. Cut off to exact length, measuring from the lines <i>a b</i>.
Then smooth both boards with the plane, nail them together with
two small nails, and square the ends. Then gauge and nick with

with spokeshave, plane, chisel, and file. Then cut out the bowl of
the ladle, using a small gouge for the edge, and a larger one for
obtaining the depth, which must be governed by the white section
shown in Fig. 3, and finished with file, scraper, and sand-paper

finished, mark on each side the curve for the under side shown in
Fig. 1. Saw just outside the line, and proceed to shape the under
side&mdash;the bowl to the shaded section of Fig. 3, and the handle to
the section of Fig. 4. For finishing the bowl, fix the handle in the
bench screw, and pare with a wide chisel, afterwards applying the
knife for completing the bowl and handle. For the finishing
touches use the file, scraper, and sand-paper.</p>

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
